        <h1 class="site-title"><u>About Me</u></h1>
            <p>I am an aerial arts teacher. I teach at <abbr title="Pole Fitness Academy"> PFA </abbr> My favourite apparatus is aerial hoop. I am passionate about teaching and dance and love inspiring and encouraging others to believe in themselves. I really enjoy costume design, choreography, and performing and I hope to perform at festivals. I would love to get other performers together and give them the opportunity to perform as well.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about music. I play guitar, sing and am learning to DJ and produce music. I am learning how to make visuals for VJ loops and would also like to design logos and posters for event companies and my friends in the electronic music industry. I volunteer and help run Safe Raving; a non-profit harm reduction organization. We attend festivals and raves to provide education on safer substance use and the risks of various substances.</p>
